Each endpoints summarry will by default be named by the view functions name. This is generally not a user friendly formatted name and this functionality can be overridden by using a docstring on your view.

- If the docstring has only one line this will become the summary of each endpoint/method.
- If the docstring has more that one line, it will form both the summary and overall discription of that enpoint/method.
